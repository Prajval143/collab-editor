Collab-Editor: Technical Documentation
Architecture Overview
The collab-editor is a web-based collaborative text editor built using Flask. The project follows a modular structure, separating concerns into distinct files and folders:

Entry Point:
run.py initializes and runs the Flask application.

Configuration:
config.py manages app configuration, including secret keys and database URIs.

Application Package:
app/ contains the core logic:

__init__.py: Initializes the Flask app, database, and registers blueprints.
models.py: Defines database models for users and documents.
auth.py: Handles user authentication (login, registration).
routes.py: Manages HTTP routes for document editing and dashboard.
ws.py: Implements WebSocket logic for real-time collaboration.
ai.py: Integrates AI features (e.g., text summarization or suggestions).
Static and Templates:

static/: Contains CSS files.
templates/: Contains HTML templates for UI.
Database:

SQLite database stored in instance/db.sqlite3.



Design Decisions
Modular Flask App:
The project is organized into modules (ai.py, auth.py, models.py, routes.py, ws.py) within the app/ directory. This separation allows for easier maintenance and future expansion.

Blueprints and Initialization:
The use of an __init__.py in app/ suggests Flask blueprints or a factory pattern, which helps keep route and feature logic isolated and manageable.

WebSocket Support:
Real-time collaboration is implemented in ws.py, enabling multiple users to edit documents simultaneously.

Authentication:
User login and registration are handled in auth.py, with templates for both (login.html, register.html). This keeps authentication logic separate from other concerns.

AI Features:
The presence of ai.py indicates planned or implemented AI-powered features, such as smart suggestions or summarization.

Database Choice:
SQLite (instance/db.sqlite3) is used for simplicity and ease of setup, suitable for development and small-scale deployment.

Static and Template Separation:
CSS is kept in static/style.css, and HTML templates are in templates/, following Flask conventions for clean separation of concerns.

Challenges Faced
Real-Time Synchronization:
Ensuring document consistency across users in real time is complex, requiring careful event handling and conflict resolution in ws.py.

Session and Security:
Managing secure user sessions, especially with concurrent WebSocket connections, is challenging and requires robust authentication and session management.

Scalability:
SQLite is not ideal for high concurrency or large-scale deployments. Scaling WebSocket connections and database access would require architectural changes.

AI Integration:
Integrating AI features without blocking the main application thread likely required asynchronous processing and careful API design.

Web Security:
Protecting against CSRF, XSS, and other vulnerabilities is essential, especially with user-generated content and authentication flows.
